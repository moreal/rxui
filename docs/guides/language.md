# LeanRx language guide

LeanRx is a restricted staged language embedded in Lean 4. Lean checks the host
program, schema indices, dependent values, and proofs; LeanRx compiles only its
own closed expression, component, view, command, and region vocabularies. It is
not an arbitrary Lean-to-JavaScript transpiler.

The repository is not a released package and has no selected license. Examples
below assume this checkout and the exact toolchain in `lean-toolchain`.

## 1. Define a typed store schema

A `Schema` is an ordered heterogeneous list. A `Field Γ α` is a typed capability
to one slot; field construction cannot name a slot with the wrong Lean type.

```lean
import LeanRx

open LeanRx

abbrev CounterSchema : Schema :=
  .field "count" Int <| .field "label" String .empty

def count : Field CounterSchema Int := .here
def label : Field CounterSchema String := .there .here
```

Field order is the stable source/derived slot order used by dependency sets,
graphs, manifests, and generated storage. Runtime browser values are restricted
to representations supported by `RuntimeType`: currently Bool, String, Int, Nat,
fixed `Vector`, and bounded `Fin` in their checked contexts. An unsupported read
fails at construction or lowering rather than acquiring an invented encoding.

## 2. Build staged expressions

`RxExpr Γ deps α` carries its complete direct dependency set in the type. Reads,
literals, scalar primitives, conditionals, and checked vector access compute the
set compositionally.

```lean
def doubled := RxExpr.binary .intMul
  (RxExpr.read count)
  (RxExpr.literal (.int 2))

def countText := RxExpr.binary .stringAppend
  (RxExpr.literal (.string "Count: "))
  (RxExpr.unary .intToString (RxExpr.read count))
```

Condition dependencies conservatively include the condition and both branches.
Lean native evaluation remains available through `RxExpr.eval`, which is useful
for native oracles and differential tests. Browser lowering supports only the
closed matrix in the [backend support guide](backend-support.md).

## 3. Declare sources and derived values

`ValueSpec.state` introduces a source with an initial scalar value.
`ValueSpec.computed` binds a staged expression to a later schema field. Sources
must form a leading prefix, names must match their declared surface roles, and
the checked graph validates dependencies, equality plans, ranks, and schedule.

```lean
def values : Array (ValueSpec CounterSchema) := #[
  ValueSpec.state count (.int 1),
  ValueSpec.computed label countText
]
```

The compiler derives representation and lawful equality metadata. Callers do not
attach an arbitrary equality strategy to a typed value.

## 4. Define events

An `EventSpec Γ` contains a closed, pure update description. The basic scalar
form sets a source from a staged expression:

```lean
def increment : EventSpec CounterSchema :=
  { name := "increment"
    update := .set count <| RxExpr.binary .intAdd
      (RxExpr.read count) (RxExpr.literal (.int 1)) }
```

Transactions apply source writes in order, compare the final source snapshot,
then propagate one affected derived phase in topological order and one sink
phase. Nested dispatch shares the outer transaction. A source written and then
restored schedules no downstream work. Event expressions currently read sources,
not freshly recomputed derived values; `LRX-TYPE-108` reports that boundary.

Specialized public specifications extend this vocabulary for dependent Tabs,
controlled forms, dynamic regions, owned effects, and the fixed structural-delta
experiment. Each remains closed and checked; application JavaScript is not the
extension mechanism.

## 5. Build a safe view

The scalar view is a small static tree. Dynamic interpolation creates or updates
text nodes. Raw HTML has no constructor.

```lean
def counterView : View CounterSchema := View.node .main [
  View.node .h1 [.text "Counter"],
  View.node .button [.text "Increment"]
    (attrs := [.buttonType .button])
    (events := [{ kind := .click, eventName := "increment" }]),
  View.node .p [.scalarText "countText" countText]
]
```

Click bindings are accepted only on native buttons. Static tag, attribute, and
event names come from closed enums; hostile strings reach text/attribute values,
not HTML or JavaScript source. The available elements and attributes are
deliberately limited; see [accessibility](accessibility.md) before inventing a
control from a generic element.

## 6. Check an explicit component

```lean
def spec : ComponentSpec CounterSchema :=
  { name := "Counter"
    values
    events := #[increment]
    view := counterView }

def checked := spec.check
```

`ComponentSpec.check` is pure and returns either a source-linked
`ComponentError` or a private `CheckedComponent`. The private constructor is the
boundary consumed by graph serialization and the component backend.

## 7. Use the scoped component surface

The optional surface records role/name/span declarations and generates
inspectable names. It is activated explicitly:

```lean
open scoped LeanRxDsl

component CounterSyntax (schema := CounterSchema) where {
  state count : Int := 1;
  derived label := rx% s!"Count: {count}";
  event increment := set count (count + 1);
  view := jsx% <main> [
    <h1> ["Counter"],
    <button type="button" onClick={increment}> ["Increment"],
    <p> [{"countText": rx% s!"Count: {count}"}]
  ];
}
```

`state name : Type := literal` covers the closed literal types `Int`, `Nat`,
`Bool`, and `String`; the declared identifier is also the schema `Field`
reference. A `derived` right-hand side may be a staged `rx%` expression or an
explicit `ValueSpec`. Events chain steps with `then`
(`set count (count + 1) then dispatch increment`), and a typed payload event
is declared `event setDraft (value : String) := set draft value;` and bound
with `onInput={setDraft}`, `onKeyDown={…}`, or `onChange={…}` on an `input`
element. `onClick={increment}` binds by reference against the declared event
inventory (or an `EventSpec` in scope outside a component). The explicit
wrapper forms remain valid:

Controlled inputs reflect state back into the DOM (ADR-0038): `value={rx% …}`
and `checked={rx% …}` are property reflections valid only on `input` elements,
`type="text"`/`type="checkbox"` select the input control, a `Bool` payload
event (`event toggleLoud (checked : Bool) := set loud checked;`) binds with
`onCheckedChange={toggleLoud}`, and a `form` element takes a payload-less
`onSubmit={save}` whose host adapter owns `preventDefault`:

```lean
component EchoMini (schema := EchoMiniSchema) where {
  state draft : String := "";
  state loud : Bool := false;
  event save := set draft "";
  event setDraft (value : String) := set draft value;
  event toggleLoud (checked : Bool) := set loud checked;
  view := jsx% <main> [
    <form onSubmit={save}> [
      <input ariaLabel="Draft" value={rx% draft} onInput={setDraft} />,
      <input ariaLabel="Loud" type="checkbox" checked={rx% loud} onCheckedChange={toggleLoud} />,
      <button type="submit"> ["Save"]
    ]
  ];
}
```

An attr-less capitalized element statically nests another checked component
when its `_spec` is in scope (ADR-0039): `<EchoMini/>` inside a later
component's view records `EchoMini` in the parent's child table, and the
parent's generated module imports and mounts `./EchoMini.mjs` in document
order with fully independent state and disposal. A capitalized head without a
matching `_spec` keeps its ordinary meaning as a typed view-term application.

A `region` item declares a keyed list with a sealed row template (ADR-0040,
ADR-0041): rows are `String` tuples behind region-owned monotone keys,
`{field}` children project row fields, and `onClick={remove}` binds the sealed
`remove` row action, which lowers to one structural delegated listener on the
region's container. `<region name/>` mounts the region as the only child of
its container element, and the `append name (expr, …)` event step pushes a row
whose field values are staged over component state:

```lean
component RosterMini (schema := RosterMiniSchema) where {
  state added : Int := 0;
  event addItem := append roster (s!"Item {added}") then set added (added + 1);
  region roster (label) := jsx% <li> [
    <span> [{label}],
    <span> [<button type="button" ariaLabel="Remove" onClick={remove}> ["✕"]]
  ];
  view := jsx% <main> [
    <button type="button" onClick={addItem}> ["Add"],
    <ul ariaLabel="Items"> [<region roster/>]
  ];
}
```

The delegated button must sit strictly inside a row cell (a direct child of
the row root) so the dispatcher can resolve the action from row structure —
`LRX-VIEW-027` rejects a button that is itself a cell.

A `row` item declares a sealed update action on a region's rows (ADR-0043):
`row roster mark := set marks (marks ++ " ★");` writes new field values —
evaluated simultaneously against the dispatching row's current fields — and
re-renders exactly that row through the region handle's `updateAt`. Row
expressions are sealed: bare row fields, string literals, and `++`
(`LRX-ELAB-115` otherwise); they also serve dynamic row text, so `{label ++
marks}` renders a concatenation that tracks row updates. A row element may
select its class from row state (ADR-0044) with
`class={if marks == "" then "roster-row" else "roster-row marked"}` — the
predicate is equality of one row field against one string literal and both
classes are static strings (`LRX-ELAB-116` otherwise):

```lean
component MarkedRosterMini (schema := MarkedRosterMiniSchema) where {
  state markedAdded : Int := 0;
  event addItem := append roster (s!"Item {markedAdded}", "")
    then set markedAdded (markedAdded + 1);
  row roster mark := set marks (marks ++ " ★");
  region roster (label, marks) := jsx%
    <li class={if marks == "" then "row" else "row marked"}> [
      <span> [{label ++ marks}],
      <span> [<button type="button" ariaLabel="Mark" onClick={mark}> ["★"]],
      <span> [<button type="button" ariaLabel="Remove" onClick={remove}> ["✕"]]
    ];
  view := jsx% <main> [
    <button type="button" onClick={addItem}> ["Add"],
    <ul ariaLabel="Items"> [<region roster/>]
  ];
}
```

A `row` item may declare one `String` payload parameter (ADR-0046):
`row roster rename (value : String) := set label value;` receives the
delegated payload in its right-hand sides through the parameter name. The
template binds payload-taking events on native `input` elements —
`onInput={rename}` delivers the input's value and `onKeyDown={record}`
delivers the pressed key — and each payload-taking event must be bound
exactly once so its payload class is determined by that binding
(`LRX-VIEW-033` otherwise). Payloads are `String` only, the parameter cannot
shadow a row field (`LRX-ELAB-117`), and `key` itself stays a reserved
surface keyword, so name the keydown parameter something else:

```lean
component EditableRosterMini (schema := EditableRosterMiniSchema) where {
  state editAdded : Int := 0;
  event addItem := append roster (s!"Item {editAdded}", "")
    then set editAdded (editAdded + 1);
  row roster rename (value : String) := set label value;
  row roster record (pressed : String) := set lastKey ("key:" ++ pressed);
  region roster (label, lastKey) := jsx% <li> [
    <span> [{label}],
    <span> [{lastKey}],
    <span> [<input ariaLabel="Rename" onInput={rename} onKeyDown={record} />],
    <span> [<button type="button" ariaLabel="Remove" onClick={remove}> ["✕"]]
  ];
  view := jsx% <main> [
    <button type="button" onClick={addItem}> ["Add"],
    <ul ariaLabel="Items"> [<region roster/>]
  ];
}
```

Rows never observe component state after mount: row expressions read only
row fields plus the declaring event's payload, `remove` and declared
`update` events are the whole action vocabulary, and each cell binds at most
one row event per delegated kind (`click`, `dblclick`, `input`, `keydown`,
and checkbox `change` — ADR-0049).

A row cell may be a sealed two-branch selection (ADR-0047):
`{if mode == "view" then <span…/> else <input…/>}` mounts one of two
statically sealed template subtrees by equality of one row field against one
string literal. The cell mounts as one wrapper element, so it occupies
exactly one row-root child index; the retained-row update callback
re-evaluates the predicate against the wrapper's compiler-owned `$lrxBranch`
marker, updates the stable branch in place, and replaces the subtree with
one `detach` plus one `append` only on a branch change — the absent branch
does not exist in the DOM or the accessibility tree. Branch cells sit only
directly under the row root and never nest (`LRX-VIEW-034`). Because the
delegated action arrays are static, both branches must bind the same action
for a kind; a one-branch binding is allowed only when the other branch
cannot originate that kind — never for `click` or `dblclick` (any content
bubbles one), only input-free branches for `input` and checkbox `change`,
and only input- and button-free branches for `keydown` (`LRX-VIEW-034`). A row `input` may also reflect a
sealed row expression into its `value` property with `value={draft}` — at
most once per element, inputs only (`LRX-VIEW-035`); a row update driven by
the input's own payload writes back the string the input already holds, so
the WHATWG equal-value assignment preserves the caret (ADR-0038, reused in
row scope). A branch-subtree input may additionally carry the bare
`autoFocus` marker (ADR-0048): inputs only, branch subtrees only, at most
one per subtree (`LRX-VIEW-036`). The update callback's replacement arm —
and only that arm — calls the ABI 16 `focus(node)` host export on the
freshly mounted branch's marked input, so focus moves exactly when the
user's action swapped in an edit affordance; row mount, reorder, and
stable-branch updates never touch focus. Together these express the TodoMVC
edit/view transition with retained row identity:

```lean
component BranchRosterMini (schema := BranchRosterMiniSchema) where {
  state branchAdded : Int := 0;
  event addItem := append roster (s!"Item {branchAdded}", s!"Item {branchAdded}", "view")
    then set branchAdded (branchAdded + 1);
  row roster edit := set mode "edit" then set draft label;
  row roster retype (value : String) := set draft value;
  row roster commit := set label draft then set mode "view";
  region roster (label, draft, mode) := jsx% <li> [
    {if mode == "view"
      then <span> [{label}]
      else <input ariaLabel="Editor" value={draft} onInput={retype} autoFocus/>},
    <span> [<button type="button" ariaLabel="Edit" onClick={edit}> ["Edit"]],
    <span> [<button type="button" ariaLabel="Commit" onClick={commit}> ["OK"]],
    <span> [<button type="button" ariaLabel="Remove" onClick={remove}> ["✕"]]
  ];
  view := jsx% <main> [
    <button type="button" onClick={addItem}> ["Add"],
    <ul ariaLabel="Items"> [<region roster/>]
  ];
}
```

Two more delegated kinds close the TodoMVC row vocabulary (ADR-0049).
`onDblClick={name}` binds a payload-less row event as the `dblclick` kind —
unlike row `click` it is permitted on non-button elements, so the label
itself can carry the edit affordance; the delegated dispatch is structural,
so no handler or `tabindex` ever lands on the label. Because a double click
bubbles from any content, it takes `click`'s exact cross-branch agreement
rule: bind the same action in both branch subtrees (typically the editor
input re-binds the same `edit` action, which is harmless when `edit` writes
only the mode field). Keep a keyboard-reachable path to the same action in
the template — a visible button as in `BranchRosterMini`, or a `keydown`
binding — when the interaction must not be pointer-only; the compiler does
not force one, matching TodoMVC's observable DOM. `onChange={name}` on a
`type="checkbox"` input binds a payload-taking row event as the checkbox
`change` kind (`LRX-VIEW-037` on any other element): the delegated `checked`
boolean lowers to the strings `"true"`/`"false"`, so the sealed `String`
update language is unchanged. Pair it with the sealed checked reflection
`checked={done == "true"}` — checkbox inputs only, at most once per element
— so the toggle state survives the retained-row update sweep and appended
rows mount with their `done` state:

```lean
component ToggleRosterMini (schema := ToggleRosterMiniSchema) where {
  state toggleAdded : Int := 0;
  event addItem := append roster (s!"Item {toggleAdded}", "false", "view")
    then set toggleAdded (toggleAdded + 1);
  row roster toggle (checked : String) := set done checked;
  row roster edit := set mode "edit";
  row roster commit := set mode "view";
  region roster (label, done, mode) := jsx% <li> [
    <span> [<input type="checkbox" ariaLabel="Done" checked={done == "true"}
      onChange={toggle}/>],
    {if mode == "view"
      then <span onDblClick={edit}> [{label}]
      else <input ariaLabel="Editor" value={label} onDblClick={edit} autoFocus/>},
    <span> [<button type="button" ariaLabel="Commit" onClick={commit}> ["OK"]],
    <span> [<button type="button" ariaLabel="Remove" onClick={remove}> ["✕"]]
  ];
  view := jsx% <main> [
    <button type="button" onClick={addItem}> ["Add"],
    <ul ariaLabel="Items"> [<region roster/>]
  ];
}
```

Whole-region observations and mutations are sealed too (ADR-0050). A
`{count region}` view child renders the region's row count and
`{count region (field == "literal")}` the count of rows whose projected
field equals the literal — text positions mounted at `"0"` (regions mount
empty) and recomputed by the commit sweep whenever the region was touched,
so they track appends, per-row updates, broadcasts, and removals alike. The
predicate is the same single-field `String` equality every sealed selection
uses, so keep the counted field canonical (`done == "false"` counts the
active rows). Two component event steps mutate every row at once:
`update region (set field (expr), …)` is the region broadcast — the
right-hand sides are sealed row expressions evaluated simultaneously against
each row's current tuple, and the keyed reconcile re-renders every retained
row with its identity, DOM node, and focus preserved — and
`remove region (field == "literal")` keeps only the rows whose field differs
from the literal, disposing exactly the matching rows. A broadcast makes the
region's rows mutable exactly as a `row` update event does. Counts must name
a declared region and field (`LRX-VIEW-038`, `LRX-ELAB-119`); broadcasts and
removals validate their targets and predicates the same way
(`LRX-TYPE-111`/`LRX-TYPE-112`, `LRX-ELAB-119`):

```lean
component CountedRosterMini (schema := CountedRosterMiniSchema) where {
  state countedAdded : Int := 0;
  event addItem := append roster (s!"Item {countedAdded}", "false")
    then set countedAdded (countedAdded + 1);
  event completeAll := update roster (set done "true");
  event clearCompleted := remove roster (done == "true");
  row roster toggle (checked : String) := set done checked;
  region roster (label, done) := jsx% <li> [
    <span> [<input type="checkbox" ariaLabel="Done" checked={done == "true"}
      onChange={toggle}/>],
    <span> [{label}]
  ];
  view := jsx% <main> [
    <button type="button" onClick={addItem}> ["Add"],
    <button type="button" onClick={completeAll}> ["Complete all"],
    <button type="button" onClick={clearCompleted}> ["Clear completed"],
    <p> [<strong> [{count roster (done == "false")}], " left of ", {count roster}],
    <ul ariaLabel="Items"> [<region roster/>]
  ];
}
```

A `filter` item selects which of a keyed region's rows are *displayed*
(ADR-0051): `filter region by field := when "literal" (rowField ==
"literal") then …` maps distinct literals of one `String` component value to
row-field equality predicates, and a state value outside the table — like
TodoMVC's `"all"` — carries no predicate and shows every row. The commit
sweep applies the table after the region's reconcile, whenever the region
was touched or the filter field changed, by writing each row root's
`hidden` property; rows never mount or dispose on a filter change, so row
identity, focus, and the region metrics stay untouched, and counts keep
reading the full row table — `items-left` is filter-independent by
construction. Filters must name a declared region at most once with a
nonempty table over distinct literals and declared row fields
(`LRX-TYPE-113`, `LRX-ELAB-120`):

```lean
component FilteredRosterMini (schema := FilteredRosterMiniSchema) where {
  state filteredAdded : Int := 0;
  state shown : String := "all";
  event addItem := append roster (s!"Item {filteredAdded}", "false")
    then set filteredAdded (filteredAdded + 1);
  event showAll := set shown "all";
  event showActive := set shown "active";
  filter roster by shown := when "active" (done == "false")
    then when "completed" (done == "true");
  row roster toggle (checked : String) := set done checked;
  region roster (label, done) := jsx% <li> [
    <span> [<input type="checkbox" ariaLabel="Done" checked={done == "true"}
      onChange={toggle}/>],
    <span> [{label}]
  ];
  view := jsx% <main> [
    <button type="button" onClick={addItem}> ["Add"],
    <button type="button" onClick={showAll}> ["Show all"],
    <button type="button" onClick={showActive}> ["Show active"],
    <ul ariaLabel="Items"> [<region roster/>]
  ];
}
```

A keydown row event may *branch* on its key payload (ADR-0052):
`row region event (pressed : String) := when "Enter" (set field (expr), …)
then when "Escape" (…)` lowers to a sealed key table — the declared
parameter is the discriminant, named in the head and compared implicitly by
each arm, the filter-table shape in row scope. A matched arm performs its
simultaneous assignments as one retained-row update; a key outside the table
is a no-op (no row scan, no update, no trace), which is what makes an
Enter-only commit expressible. Key literals come from the sealed
`Enter`/`Escape` set, each at most once; arm right-hand sides are
payload-free (the key literal already fixes the payload); and the event
binds through `onKeyDown` exactly once on a native input — all
`LRX-VIEW-039`, with `LRX-ELAB-121` pinning the surface (a `when` arm needs
the declared parameter and mixes with no other steps). The equality runs
inside the generated dispatch function over the delegated `key` argument, so
there is no host change and no ABI bump:

```lean
component KeyedEditorMini (schema := KeyedEditorMiniSchema) where {
  state keyedAdded : Int := 0;
  event addItem := append roster (s!"Item {keyedAdded}", s!"Item {keyedAdded}", "view")
    then set keyedAdded (keyedAdded + 1);
  row roster edit := set mode "edit";
  row roster retype (value : String) := set draft value;
  row roster keys (pressed : String) := when "Enter" (set label draft, set mode "view")
    then when "Escape" (set draft label, set mode "view");
  region roster (label, draft, mode) := jsx% <li> [
    {if mode == "view"
      then <span onDblClick={edit}> [{label}]
      else <input ariaLabel="Editor" value={draft} onInput={retype}
        onKeyDown={keys} onDblClick={edit} autoFocus/>}
  ];
  view := jsx% <main> [
    <button type="button" onClick={addItem}> ["Add"],
    <ul ariaLabel="Items"> [<region roster/>]
  ];
}
```

Enter commits (`label := draft`, back to the view branch) and Escape reverts
(`draft := label` restores the pre-edit text, since `label` changes only on
commit), so the next edit entry opens pre-filled with the restored draft
through the value reflection.

A static view element may select its `class`, `aria-pressed`, or `disabled`
from component state (ADR-0045):
`class={if filter == "all" then "selected" else ""}` selects between two
static class strings, `ariaPressed={filter == "all"}` reflects the equality
as `"true"`/`"false"`, and `disabled={filter == "all"}` reflects it as the
boolean element property. The predicate is equality of one `String`
component value (source or derived) against one string literal; the field
reference is the ordinary schema `Field`, so a non-`String` field is a plain
Lean type error. Selections join the commit sweep beside text sinks and
reflected properties with the evaluate-compare-write shape. A selection
counts as its attribute for duplicate detection (`LRX-VIEW-001`), and
`aria-pressed`/`disabled` selections require a native button
(`LRX-VIEW-032`); other shapes report the sealed surface (`LRX-VIEW-012`):

```lean
component FilterMini (schema := FilterMiniSchema) where {
  state filter : String := "all";
  event showAll := set filter "all";
  event showActive := set filter "active";
  view := jsx% <main> [
    <button type="button" onClick={showAll}
        class={if filter == "all" then "selected" else ""}
        ariaPressed={filter == "all"}> ["All"],
    <button type="button" onClick={showActive}
        class={if filter == "active" then "selected" else ""}
        ariaPressed={filter == "active"}> ["Active"],
    <button type="button" onClick={showAll} disabled={filter == "all"}> ["Reset"]
  ];
}
```

A `prop` item declares an immutable `String` input that the parent supplies
through the mount ABI (ADR-0042): the child renders it with a `{title}` text
child, its module's signature becomes `mount(target, props)`, and a parent
passes values as literal attributes — `<TitledMini title="Hello"/>` — which
must match the child's declared prop names and order exactly
(`LRX-ELAB-112` otherwise):

```lean
component TitledMini (schema := TitledMiniSchema) where {
  state clicks : Int := 0;
  prop title : String;
  event bump := set clicks (clicks + 1);
  view := jsx% <main> [
    <h1> [{title}],
    <button type="button" onClick={bump}> ["Bump"]
  ];
}
```

```lean
component CounterExplicitSyntax (schema := CounterSchema) where {
  state count := ValueSpec.state count (.int 1);
  derived label := ValueSpec.computed label countText;
  event increment := increment;
  view := counterView;
}
```

The complete form of this canonical snippet is compiled in
`Test/Docs/LanguageGuide.lean`. This generates `CounterSyntax_schema`, `CounterSyntax_declarations`,
`CounterSyntax_spec`, and `CounterSyntax_check`. The generated declaration
inventory is checked against the actual roles and names; it is not decorative.
Builds may emit a small `.generated.lean` alias module for editor inspection.

### Stage expressions with rx%

`rx%` stages ordinary Lean expression syntax into the same closed `RxExpr`
core the explicit constructors build — identical primitives, literals, and
dependency sets:

```lean
open scoped LeanRxDsl

def doubled := rx% count * 2
def parity := rx% if count % 2 == 0 then "even" else "odd"
def countText := rx% s!"Count: {count}"
def increment : EventSpec CounterSchema :=
  { name := "increment", update := .set count (rx% count + 1) }
```

Leaves stage by type: schema fields read, staged expressions splice, and
`Bool`/`Int`/`Nat`/`String` values lift into literals. Anything else fails
with `error[LRX-RX-001]` at the leaf.

### Target the logical region model

`jsx%` selects its lowering from the expected type. Against
`Region.LogicalNode` it produces the logical reference model used by dynamic
region applications and differential tests: attributes and text may be dynamic
terms, keyed list children lower onto the keyed region IR, and a capitalized
element nests another component as a typed application:

```lean
def TodoRow (todo : Item) (editing : Bool) (draft : String) : LogicalNode :=
  jsx% <li dataKey={toString todo.id}
      class={if todo.completed then "completed" else "active"}> [
    { if editing then draft else todo.title }
  ]

def rows (model : State) : List KeyedItem :=
  jsx% for todo in visible model key todo.id =>
    <TodoRow todo={todo} editing={model.editing == some todo.id}
      draft={model.draft}/>
```

A prop declared as an M6 `ImmutableProp` wraps its value through
`ImmutableProp.of` with the attribute name. Mode mismatches keep stable
diagnostics (`LRX-VIEW-011` keyed list in a typed view, `LRX-VIEW-012` dynamic
values in a typed view, `LRX-VIEW-013` events in the logical model). Surface
keywords (`state`, `derived`, `event`, `view`, `key`) cannot double as
identifiers where `LeanRxDsl` is open.

## 8. Compile and inspect

Registered applications can be checked and built through the repository CLI:

```sh
lake exe leanrx -- check Examples.Counter
lake exe leanrx -- graph Examples.Counter --format html > Counter.graph.html
lake exe leanrx -- build Examples.Counter --out .tmp/counter
```

Build publication is atomic and versioned. An unmanaged existing output path is
rejected. Generated artifacts include a validated ESM module, exact manifest,
JSON/DOT/HTML graphs, host modules, and application-specific editor aliases.

## 9. Dependent values, forms, regions, and effects

- `TabsSpec` accepts equal nonempty `Vector` props, `Fin` selection, and finite
  handlers. Proofs are erased and checked not to influence runtime inspection.
- Form specifications preserve raw controlled input, parse through a closed
  grammar, and expose refined submit capabilities only after validation.
- Conditional, positional, and keyed regions reconcile local dynamic shape while
  retaining stable instances and explicit disposal. There is no root Virtual DOM.
- `Cmd Msg`, resources, and foreign ports make timers, storage, HTTP, decoding,
  cancellation, stale-result suppression, and disposal ownership explicit.
- `ListDelta` is an opt-in checked library experiment, not a default core feature.

Follow the linked guides in [the documentation index](../README.md) and inspect
the corresponding public dogfood examples before using these specialized APIs.

## 10. Current limitations

LeanRx does not currently provide a URL router, general VDOM, arbitrary Lean
transpilation, raw HTML, URL attributes, a CSS DSL, SSR, hydration, a released
package, or a formal proof relating generated JavaScript to browser DOM behavior.
The self-hosted documentation site records how these gaps affect a real build.
