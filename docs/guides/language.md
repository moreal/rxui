# LeanRx language guide

LeanRx is a restricted staged language embedded in Lean 4. Lean checks the host
program, schema indices, dependent values, and proofs; LeanRx compiles only its
own closed expression, component, view, command, and region vocabularies. It is
not an arbitrary Lean-to-JavaScript transpiler.

The repository is not a released package and has no selected license. Examples
below assume this checkout and the exact toolchain in `lean-toolchain`.

## 1. Define a typed store schema

A `Schema` is an ordered heterogeneous list. A `Field Γ α` is a typed capability
to one slot; field construction cannot name a slot with the wrong Lean type.

```lean
import LeanRx

open LeanRx

abbrev CounterSchema : Schema :=
  .field "count" Int <| .field "label" String .empty

def count : Field CounterSchema Int := .here
def label : Field CounterSchema String := .there .here
```

Field order is the stable source/derived slot order used by dependency sets,
graphs, manifests, and generated storage. Runtime browser values are restricted
to representations supported by `RuntimeType`: currently Bool, String, Int, Nat,
fixed `Vector`, and bounded `Fin` in their checked contexts. An unsupported read
fails at construction or lowering rather than acquiring an invented encoding.

## 2. Build staged expressions

`RxExpr Γ deps α` carries its complete direct dependency set in the type. Reads,
literals, scalar primitives, conditionals, and checked vector access compute the
set compositionally.

```lean
def doubled := RxExpr.binary .intMul
  (RxExpr.read count)
  (RxExpr.literal (.int 2))

def countText := RxExpr.binary .stringAppend
  (RxExpr.literal (.string "Count: "))
  (RxExpr.unary .intToString (RxExpr.read count))
```

Condition dependencies conservatively include the condition and both branches.
Lean native evaluation remains available through `RxExpr.eval`, which is useful
for native oracles and differential tests. Browser lowering supports only the
closed matrix in the [backend support guide](backend-support.md).

## 3. Declare sources and derived values

`ValueSpec.state` introduces a source with an initial scalar value.
`ValueSpec.computed` binds a staged expression to a later schema field. Sources
must form a leading prefix, names must match their declared surface roles, and
the checked graph validates dependencies, equality plans, ranks, and schedule.

```lean
def values : Array (ValueSpec CounterSchema) := #[
  ValueSpec.state count (.int 1),
  ValueSpec.computed label countText
]
```

The compiler derives representation and lawful equality metadata. Callers do not
attach an arbitrary equality strategy to a typed value.

## 4. Define events

An `EventSpec Γ` contains a closed, pure update description. The basic scalar
form sets a source from a staged expression:

```lean
def increment : EventSpec CounterSchema :=
  { name := "increment"
    update := .set count <| RxExpr.binary .intAdd
      (RxExpr.read count) (RxExpr.literal (.int 1)) }
```

Transactions apply source writes in order, compare the final source snapshot,
then propagate one affected derived phase in topological order and one sink
phase. Nested dispatch shares the outer transaction. A source written and then
restored schedules no downstream work. Event expressions currently read sources,
not freshly recomputed derived values; `LRX-TYPE-108` reports that boundary.

Specialized public specifications extend this vocabulary for dependent Tabs,
controlled forms, dynamic regions, owned effects, and the fixed structural-delta
experiment. Each remains closed and checked; application JavaScript is not the
extension mechanism.

## 5. Build a safe view

The scalar view is a small static tree. Dynamic interpolation creates or updates
text nodes. Raw HTML has no constructor.

```lean
def view : View CounterSchema := View.node .main [
  View.node .h1 [.text "Counter"],
  View.node .button [.text "Increment"]
    (attrs := [.buttonType .button])
    (events := [{ kind := .click, eventName := "increment" }]),
  View.node .p [.scalarText "countText" countText]
]
```

Click bindings are accepted only on native buttons. Static tag, attribute, and
event names come from closed enums; hostile strings reach text/attribute values,
not HTML or JavaScript source. The available elements and attributes are
deliberately limited; see [accessibility](accessibility.md) before inventing a
control from a generic element.

## 6. Check an explicit component

```lean
def spec : ComponentSpec CounterSchema :=
  { name := "Counter"
    values
    events := #[increment]
    view }

def checked := spec.check
```

`ComponentSpec.check` is pure and returns either a source-linked
`ComponentError` or a private `CheckedComponent`. The private constructor is the
boundary consumed by graph serialization and the component backend.

## 7. Use the scoped component surface

The optional surface records role/name/span declarations and generates
inspectable names. It is activated explicitly:

```lean
open scoped LeanRxDsl

component CounterSyntax (schema := CounterSchema) where {
  state count := ValueSpec.state count (.int 1);
  derived label := ValueSpec.computed label countText;
  event increment := increment;
  view := view;
}
```

This generates `CounterSyntax_schema`, `CounterSyntax_declarations`,
`CounterSyntax_spec`, and `CounterSyntax_check`. The generated declaration
inventory is checked against the actual roles and names; it is not decorative.
Builds may emit a small `.generated.lean` alias module for editor inspection.

## 8. Compile and inspect

Registered applications can be checked and built through the repository CLI:

```sh
lake exe leanrx -- check Examples.Counter
lake exe leanrx -- graph Examples.Counter --format html > Counter.graph.html
lake exe leanrx -- build Examples.Counter --out .tmp/counter
```

Build publication is atomic and versioned. An unmanaged existing output path is
rejected. Generated artifacts include a validated ESM module, exact manifest,
JSON/DOT/HTML graphs, host modules, and application-specific editor aliases.

## 9. Dependent values, forms, regions, and effects

- `TabsSpec` accepts equal nonempty `Vector` props, `Fin` selection, and finite
  handlers. Proofs are erased and checked not to influence runtime inspection.
- Form specifications preserve raw controlled input, parse through a closed
  grammar, and expose refined submit capabilities only after validation.
- Conditional, positional, and keyed regions reconcile local dynamic shape while
  retaining stable instances and explicit disposal. There is no root Virtual DOM.
- `Cmd Msg`, resources, and foreign ports make timers, storage, HTTP, decoding,
  cancellation, stale-result suppression, and disposal ownership explicit.
- `ListDelta` is an opt-in checked library experiment, not a default core feature.

Follow the linked guides in [the documentation index](../README.md) and inspect
the corresponding public dogfood examples before using these specialized APIs.

## 10. Current limitations

LeanRx does not currently provide a URL router, general VDOM, arbitrary Lean
transpilation, raw HTML, URL attributes, a CSS DSL, SSR, hydration, a released
package, or a formal proof relating generated JavaScript to browser DOM behavior.
The self-hosted documentation site records how these gaps affect a real build.
