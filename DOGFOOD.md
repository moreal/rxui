# Dogfood log

## M0 tooling smoke

### Scenario exercised

Pinned-toolchain Lake build and a public-library import from the native test
executable.

### What was pleasant

The required Lean 4.33.0 toolchain was already present, so the baseline required
no network fetch and produced a small dependency-free manifest.

### Friction

A module documentation comment cannot directly annotate a namespace in Lean
4.33.0; using a module comment fixed the root module cleanly. pnpm is not
available, but JavaScript tooling is intentionally deferred until M3.

### Missing framework capability

All user-facing framework capabilities are intentionally absent in M0.

### Bugs found

The initial root comment form caused a parser error. It was corrected before the
bootstrap commit; the native smoke executable covers import and version access.

### Performance observations

The dependency-free clean build completed in under three seconds on the baseline
machine. This is a tooling observation, not a framework benchmark.

### Follow-up issue or commit

`14d44a6 chore(repo): initialize LeanRx Lake package`
